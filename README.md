# Inception-v3 & Django Web App Instance for Multiple Myeloma
This web application exploits the notrious Inception-v3 architecture via transfer learning and the Django web application interface for active Leukemia/MultpleMyeloma classification. The Inception model uses recursive bottleneck layers and high-order dense connections for rapid data-feature extraction and final classification training on the Softmax activation node. Transfer learning with Inception v-3 can be accomplished with well-known examples, such as the Flowers repositor
